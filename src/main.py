#TO DO:

# hand strength probabilities (bitwise method?)
# continue making new rounds until one player has most of the money (other players do not have enough for big blind)
# all in
# compartmentalize into separate modules



# person after big blind always goes first - done
## fix the fucked up betting amounts - done (was performing redundant actions after bet_amt was initialized with blind amt)
# # initialize current bet with big blind - done


# List of issues to fix:
# getting the specific round's history for each player
